    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This dish is fucking mint lads. It's so spicy and delicious. It's gonna make your hairs on your chest all strong and that. If you're a real badass you'll make it with a shit ton of green chilli.</p>
    <p>This dish is also part of the timecube conspiracy. It has four simultaneous flavours, in a 48 hour cycle at opposite poles. The educators lied to you. Ignoring this is evil.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Frango</li>
        <li>Spicy shit</li>
        <li>Flavoury shit</li>
        <li>Some herbs and that</li>
        <li>Jenifer Aniston</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Kill and pluck the frango</li>
        <li>Ask Jennifer how many chillis she wants</li>
        <li>However many she tells you, add two more</li>
        <li>I dunno, put some herbs and that in the sauce too</li>
        <li>You did make the sauce, right? It's with coconut milk</li>
        <li>Pour over raw rice and consume</li>
    </ol>
